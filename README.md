# Hackathon III: Reusable Intelligence & Cloud-Native Mastery 🏆

Welcome to the **LearnFlow Ecosystem**, a state-of-the-art demonstration of **Specification-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence (SDD-RI)**.

## 🌟 The Vision

This project transforms AI development from "chatting and guessing" into a governed, scalable, and autonomous engineering discipline. By separating **Intent (Specs)** from **Execution (Skills)**, we achieve 99% token efficiency and full cross-agent portability.
